@article{Dunstan2013,
abstract = {Understanding how species distributions respond as a function of environmental gradients is a key question in ecology, and will benefit from a multi-species approach. Multi-species data are often high dimensional, in that the number of species sampled is often large relative to the number of sites, and are commonly quantified as either presence–absence, counts of individuals, or biomass of each species. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the analysis of multi-species data when the goal is to understand how each species responds to their environment. We use a finite mixture of regression models, grouping species into “Archetypes” according to their environmental response, thereby significantly reducing the dimension of the regression model. Previous research introduced such Species Archetype Models (SAMs), but only for binary assemblage data. Here, we extend this basic framework with three key innovations: (1) the method is expanded to handle count and biomass data, (2) we propose grouping on the slope coefficients only, whilst the intercept terms and nuisance parameters remain species-specific, and (3) we develop model diagnostic tools for SAMs. By grouping on environmental responses only, the model allows for inter-species variation in terms of overall prevalence and abundance. The application of our expanded SAM framework data is illustrated on marine survey data and through simulation.},

@article{Parraga-Alava2018,
abstract = {Biologists aim to understand the genetic background of diseases, metabolic disorders or any other genetic condition. Microarrays are one of the main high-throughput technologies for collecting information about the behaviour of genetic information on different conditions. In order to analyse this data, clustering arises as one of the main techniques used, and it aims at finding groups of genes that have some criterion in common, like similar expression profile. However, the problem of finding groups is normally multi dimensional, making necessary to approach the clustering as a multi-objective problem where various cluster validity indexes are simultaneously optimised. They are usually based on criteria like compactness and separation, which may not be sufficient since they can not guarantee the generation of clusters that have both similar expression patterns and biological coherence.},

@article{Pritchard2000,
abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to  infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

Although many biotelemetry devices record 3D location data with x, y, and z coordinates from tracked animals, the third z coordinate is typically not integrated into studies of animal spatial use. Disregarding the vertical component may seriously limit understanding of animal habitat use and niche separation. We present novel movement-based kernel density estimators and computer visualization tools for generating and exploring 3D home ranges based on location data. We use case studies of three wildlife species – giant panda, dugong, and California condor – to demonstrate the ecological insights and conservation management benefits provided by 3D home range estimation and visualization for terrestrial, aquatic, and avian wildlife research.},

We use Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to describe the diving behaviour of a narwhal and fit the models to a three-dimensional response vector of maximum dive depth, duration of dives and post-dive surface time of 8,609 dives measured in East Greenland over 83 days, an extraordinarily long and rich data set. Narwhal diving patterns have not been analysed like this before, but in studies of other whale species, response variables have been assumed independent. We extend the existing models to allow for dependence between state distributions, and show that the dependence has an impact on the conclusions drawn about the diving behaviour. We try several HMMs with 2, 3 or 4 states, and with independent and dependent log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and different covariates to characterize dive patterns. In particular, diurnal patterns in diving behaviour is inferred, by using periodic B-splines with boundary knots in 0 and 24 hours.},

abstract = {Abstract Discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) have become an immensely popular tool for inferring latent animal behaviours from telemetry data. While movement HMMs typically rely solely on location data (e.g. step length and turning angle), auxiliary biotelemetry and environmental data are powerful and readily-available resources for incorporating much more ecological and behavioural realism. However, complex movement or observation process models often necessitate custom and computationally demanding HMM model-fitting techniques that are impractical for most practitioners, and there is a paucity of generalized user-friendly software available for implementing multivariate HMMs of animal movement. Here, we introduce an open-source R package, momentuHMM, that addresses many of the deficiencies in existing HMM software. Features include: (1) data pre-processing and visualization; (2) user-specified probability distributions for an unlimited number of data streams and latent behaviour states; (3) biased and correlated random walk movement models, including dynamic “activity centres” associated with attractive or repulsive forces; (4) user-specified design matrices and constraints for covariate modelling of parameters using formulas familiar to most R users; (5) multiple imputation methods that account for measurement error and temporally irregular or missing data; (6) seamless integration of spatio-temporal covariate raster data; (7) cosinor and spline models for cyclical and other complicated patterns; (8) model checking and selection; and (9) simulation. After providing an overview of the main features of the package, we demonstrate some of the capabilities of momentuHMM using real-world examples. These include models for cyclical movement patterns of African elephants, foraging trips of northern fur seals, loggerhead turtle movements relative to ocean surface currents, and grey seal movements among three activity centres. momentuHMM considerably extends the capabilities of existing HMM software while accounting for common challenges associated with telemetry data. It therefore facilitates more realistic hypothesis-driven animal movement analyses that have hitherto been largely inaccessible to non-statisticians. While motivated by telemetry data, the package can be used for analysing any type of data that is amenable to HMMs. Practitioners interested in additional features are encouraged to contact the authors.},

ABSTRACT = {Recent and archived data from weather radar networks are extensively used for the quantification of continent-wide bird migration patterns. While the process of discriminating birds from weather signals is well established, insect contamination is still a problem. We present a simple method combining two Doppler radar products within a Gaussian mixture model to estimate the proportions of birds and insects within a single measurement volume, as well as the density and speed of birds and insects. This method can be applied to any existing archives of vertical bird profiles, such as the European Network for the Radar surveillance of Animal Movement repository, with no need to recalculate the huge amount of original polar volume data, which often are not available.},
